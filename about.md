Hi. I'm Richard Vankoningsveld, a law librarian from Brisbane Australia.

This is my blog. I've blogged in a few places over the years, and on different subjects. This blog amalgamates some of that old blog content, along with [Medium posts](https://medium.com/@richyvk/) I've written.

I am a hobbiest coder who dabbles in web development and data analysis. I think I'm fairly proficient in writing HTML and CSS now, and I have some JavaScript and jQuery knowledge, although my main focus is currently Python. 

I mostly blog about the stuff I've learned, things I've built, and how I set up my coding environment. You might find a bit of library stuff here too.

When I'm not writing or working or doing the family thing, I also help run the [Australian Law Librarians' Association](http://alla.asn.au/). You might also find me at a [BrisPy meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Python-User-Group/), or helping out with the [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) community.

I've titled all my blogs/websites for the last little while Pitt Street Press. The reason is somewhat complicated. One day I hop it will all become clear.

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (although one day I'd like to convert it to use [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/)) and a customised version of the [Type Theme](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme). It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
