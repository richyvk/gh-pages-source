description: Learning Python with free MOOCs
---

I’ve had a change of direction since I resurrected my blogging efforts. I have found 24 things to be pretty uninspiring I’m afraid. I’m sure many people get a lot out of it, but it’s not for me.

I have been keeping busy with my professional development though, and have been working my way through various resources trying to teach myself the program in Python.

I have previously started learning Ruby, and I’ve completed a couple of courses in Javascript and HTML/CSS through CodeAcademy.

Ruby I could never really get excited about, but Python I am really enjoying. It seems to me like it’s more mature as a language and so there are a lot more resources around to help the learner, be they structured courses or just examples and explanations on StackExchange.

So, here’s what I’ve been using to help me learn:

* [Programming foundations with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud036) – free course through Udacity, not very long, but a good introduction to certain aspects of programming, particularly the concept of Objects
* [Web development](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253) – another free Udacity course, much longer (I haven’t completed it yet), and steps through the process of creating a web application using Python and Google App Engine. The lecturer used to work at Reddit I think. The course assumes Python experience so it’s a step up from the first course. Very good so far.
* [A Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/) – a book written by an Indian programmer and blogger named Swaroop CH.  Excellent starter book for learning Python
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) – another book on learning Python. Focuses on doing lots of  fairly repetitive ‘drills’ involving lots of typing. A bit annoying for a crap typist like me, but it does help the remembering process. Quite a Victorian approach to learning I reckon.
For the first time recently, I feel like I’m starting to really understanding programming, at least at a basic level. Not sure where I’ll go from here, but for now I’m just going to keep doing tutorials and MOOCs. It’s fun, so why not.
