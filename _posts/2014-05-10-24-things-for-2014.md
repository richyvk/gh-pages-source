I have finally started doing 24 things this year, I thought is used to be 23 things but we must have added one.

I’m doing it through QUT were I work an evening shift as a casual reference librarian. We’re using Yammer as the platform, but a recent thing was about blogging and writing for the web.

This prompted me to resurrect my domain, set up a blog, and start recording some of the recent PD activity I’ve been doing. This is probably my 10th blog (at least), which is embarrassing. If I write that down then hopefully it will mean I stick at this one. It’s not going to be updated every day that’s for sure, but hopefully somewhat regularly, when I have something interesting to report.

We shall see…
