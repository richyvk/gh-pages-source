title: Web applications in baby steps with Flask - part 1

This is the first in what I hope will be an ongoing series charting my progress learning how to make web applications with Flask.

## Some background

I have been writing HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript and jQuery for some time now, learning Python for a year or two on and off, and doing FreeCodeCamp for about six months. My aim over this time has been to improve my skills at web design and ultimately learn how to build my own web applications, and by web applications I mean at the very least websites that are database driven where content is dynamically generated in response to user activity.

FreeCodeCamp offers a pretty comprehensive curriculum for learning how to make web apps, from basic html, css, jQuery, JavaScript, and ultimately making web apps with ExpressJS and NodeJS. This is fine, and I know javascript based frameworks are all the rage at the moment, but it presented a problem for me. Namely I don’t really like javascript that much. Don’t get me wrong, I love working with jQuery for DOM manipulation, but I find pure JS a struggle and not fun to use. So, the prospect of learning a web app framework based on JS didn’t exactly fill me with excitement.

In contrast I had looked at Flask a while back and liked what I saw, but at the time I felt I wasn’t ready to learn web development. Instead I focused on learning the basics of programming with Python, and I found I really loved using it. I can’t exactly say why, but I think it’s a combination of loving the syntax and the fact it’s a general purpose language so I could do all sorts of stuff with Python outside of a browser and unrelated to web development. This meant I could use Python to do some stuff I needed to do for work and at home (think Automate the Boring Stuff). I think this really helped to cement some understanding of programming and of using Python for me.

And so, a year or so after I really started seriously trying to learn some Python, and getting sidetracked into JS for a while via FreeCodeCamp, here I am back in Python land and embarking on a journey to learn Flask. This time it feels like exactly the right framework to use for me. I’m actually excited about learning again!
